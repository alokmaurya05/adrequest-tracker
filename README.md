## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:
JDK 1.8
Maven 3
## Task
You must write an HTTP service that 
- receives requests generated by our collector
- check the validity of each request
- reject invalid requests
- count and store statistics per customer per hour
Your code should contain a stub function to which you should pass all valid requests.

The service must also provide
- an endpoint to get the statistics
  - for a specific customer 
  AND
  - a specific day
The response must also contain the total number of requests for that day.

#Requests considered as invalid are:
* malformed JSON
* missing one or more fields
* with a customer ID not found in the database or for a customer which is disabled
* with a remote IP address which is in the blacklist
* with a user agent which is in the blacklist

#The stats table will contain:
* one entry per hour and per customer ID
* the `request_count` column contains the number of valid requests
* the `invalid_count` column will be used for the number of invalid requests

# Sample Request
```json
{"customerID":1,"tagID":2,"userID":"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-1111-222222222222","remoteIP":"123.234.56.78","timestamp":1500000000}
```

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.adtrack.AdtrackApplication class from your IDE.
Alternatively you can use below command [more information see](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin) .

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

```python
Spring Security will ask to to enter UserName & Password
User Name: admin
Password: password

To see Data in browser go to http://localhost:8085/h2-console

API document is written in swagger 
please go to http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html#/

How to Dockerize Spring Boot Application
Go to docker console inside project target directory run the following command 

Build Docker Image
$ docker build -t adtrack.jar .

Check Docker Image
$ docker image ls

Run Docker Image
$ docker run -p 9090:8085 adtrack.jar

In the run command, we have specified that the port 8085 on the container should be mapped to the port 9090 on the Host OS.
```

## Packaging & run  
```
mvn clean install

Default packaging is jar and save it in /target directory 
Copy the jar file. Put any directory go to that directory and run the command:  java -jar adtrack-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Save customer data via post method.
Open the browser http://localhost:8085/api/v1/customer  
It will ask UserName: admin  & Password: password  then click Singin

```
